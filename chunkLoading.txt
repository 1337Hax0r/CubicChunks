Things that call loadChunk():

ServerConfigurationManager.func_72375_a( )
	loads the chunk at a player
	return ignored
	
ServerConfigurationManager.respawnPlayer( )
	loads the chunk at the player
	return ignored, but checks world for bounding boxes
	later, playerManager.addPlayer();

MinecraftServer.initialWorldChunkLoad( )
	loads all the chunks near the spawn
	12 chunks in each direction
	return ignored

PlayerManager
	overridden by CubicChunkPlayerManager

EntityPlayer.verifyRespawnCoordinates( )
	loads chunks within 3 blocks of target block


Things that call provideChunk():

World.getChunkFromChunkCoords( )
	called by everything and its mother...
	maybe we should pass back the currently-loaded column and don't load any requested cubic chunks
	that way, cubic chunks are only loaded by player movement, and spawn point proximity

World.isBlockNormalCubeDefault( )
	looks for chunk at block position

Chunk.populate( )
	looks for chunks at (x,z), (x-1,z), (x,z-1), and (x-1,z-1)
